## LICENSE NOTES

Sauerbraten source code license, usage, and documentation.

You may use the Sauerbraten source code if you abide by the ZLIB license
http://www.opensource.org/licenses/zlib-license.php
(very similar to the BSD license)

The license covers the source code found in the "src" directory of this
archive as well as the .cfg files under the "data" directory. The included 
ENet network library which Sauerbraten uses is covered by an MIT-style 
license, which is however compatible with the above license for all 
practical purposes.

Game media included in the game (maps, textures, sounds, models etc.)
are NOT covered by this license, and may have individual copyrights and
distribution restrictions (see individual readmes).
