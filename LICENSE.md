# License

The game is freeware, you may freely distribute the archive and/or installer _unmodified_ on any media.
You may re-compress using different archival formats suitable for your OS (i.e. zip/tgz/rpm/deb/dmg), any changes beyond that require explicit permission from the developers.

You may play Cube 2: Sauerbraten for any purpose as long as you don't blame the authors for any damages incurred.

If you want to produce new content with the Cube 2 Engine, you have to be aware that the source code may be Open Source, but the game and the media it consist of have their individual licenses and copyrights.
This means that you have roughly 3 options:

* You may produce new content for the &quot;Sauerbraten&quot; game, for example as a _custom map_ (.ogz/.cfg/textures etc). Contributing _content_ to the original game is most welcome, and the most productive way of working with the community.

* If you want to create your own gameplay beyond what you can do with a map, the best way to do this is as a &quot;mod&quot; (same as above, but with new executable that incorporates your gameplay), that _requires an existing install_, and _installs only the new files_ you created in parallel to the existing files.

* If you insist on making a standalone game based on Cube 2, do realize that _only the sourcecode_ is yours to use freely (if you abide by the ZLIB license, see below),while the media is _not_. You can't simply redistribute the entire package with your modified files, as the majority of game media is not yours to use freely (it is made by many authors with a variety of licences and copyright restrictions). Unless you have explicit permission from the authors, or the readme says explicitly "may be used for any purpose" or similar language, it will be illegal to include in your standalone game based on the engine (you may not assume that just because a file has no explicit license, that it is free of copyright). Therefore, if you wish to produce a standalone game, be prepared to make many of the maps, models, textures, sounds etc from scratch yourself.

In this sense Cube 2: Sauerbraten is similar to games like Quake (its code is Open Source, but its media is not), it is a game that is meant
to be added to, not copied and used as a template. Sauerbraten is not meant to be a quick game creation kit, it is a game.

If you wish to use the source code (ZLIB license) in any way, read the src/LICENSE.md file carefully.
